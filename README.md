Coursework for Univeristy of Massachusetts Lowell.
Course Title: Operating Systems.

This course focused on processes scheduling, operating system architecture, and internal memory management.

Final Project: Memory Managmenet Unit
- Developed a simulation of a memory management unit (MMU) that functions within an operating system.
- Created a network of Linux threads to act as processes requesting portions of the CPU RAM.
- Kept a queue of requests that were too large to fill at the time and needed to be filled later.
- Supported multiple additional features such as: user-selected memory fit type, defragmentation toggle, and priority 
scheduling.
